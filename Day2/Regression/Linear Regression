# Simple Linear Regression with Python

This repository contains a basic example of implementing simple linear regression using Python with scikit-learn.

## Overview

Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Code

The Notebook (`linear_regression.ipynb`) in this repository demonstrates how to generate random data, split it into training and testing sets, create a linear regression model, and visualize the results.
